<p>
How can you create a fictional planet or solar system and keep it believable? Especially in hard science fiction, 
making a mistake that makes the planet simply impossible in real life might annoy an audience if they can see 
why it is impossible. And as an author, you may just find it satisfying to know that the planets you 
create are genuinely possible.
</p>

<p>
The question is really about avoiding mistakes. And the most likely mistakes are probably in
the star system's thermodynamics and chemistry or in its orbit. For both these, we have a history and a present,
and they can both be wrong.
</p>

<p>
I should say that I hope this
article is accurate but the reader should understand that if a detail is important to them, they should check 
the references provided for confirmation. I could be wrong about anything.
</p>

<p>
To start with, here's a brief overview of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebular_hypothesis#Formation_of_planets">planet formation</a>.

<h3>Planet Formation: Dynamics</h3>

<p> This is about the mass and orbit of the planets only.

<p>
It is thought that most solar systems form in roughly the same way: Galaxies have a lot of gas and 
dust floating around in them. In more dense regions of gas and dust, a collapse can occur where the 
densest regions become so heavy that they gravitationally attract more and more gas and dust until 
the whole mess forms a huge ball of gas --- a new star. Because the original gas cloud probably had
some random angular momentum, the result is a star in the centre, and a lot of gas and dust in orbit 
around it. Any pocket of gas/dust that is orbiting in a different plane or the opposite direction will 
eventually crash into other gas/dust and the result is that a disk forms with most of the gas circling 
in the same plane and direction.
</p>

<p>
This is the normal starting point for discussions of planet formation: A central star, surrounded by 
a disk of gas and dust. The next step is for the gas and dust to form planets. This process is not fully 
understood: There is debate about which mechanisms are usually dominant, and there are problems that
are not fully resolved. 
</p>

<p>The gas and dust in the protoplanetary disk, in order to form planets, has to stick together. 
The simplest model for this (which is at least slightly wrong) is that dust sticks together to form 
pebbles, and these gradually stick together with other pebbles all the way until we have planets.
</p>
<p>
The two problems with this is that metre-sized rocks would spiral inwards too quickly in a gas cloud 
(because the gas cloud actually moves slightly more slowly than the orbital speed of the rock), and 
it takes such a long time to form planets that the hydrogen gas dissipates before it can form large gas 
giants.
</p>

<p>It is thought that instabilities and fluctuations within protoplanetary disks can bypass both of 
these problems, and so the conclusion reached is largely thought to be correct: The early solar system 
produced very many planetesimals that then interact gravitationally and through collisions to create the 
final solar system.</p>

<p><strike> The system can be approximated by several thousand planetesimals,
and an N-body simulation keeps track of how they interact over the next million years or so. </strike>An example of 
this type of simulation dates back to 2002: <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/344105/">
Formation of Protoplanet Systems and Diversity of Planetary Systems</a>.
</p>

<p>The results, if done properly, are a number of planets, spaced out reasonably similarly to in our solar 
system, and all on relatively normal orbits. The interaction between many small planetesimals and larger 
planets tends to push the heavier planets into "nice" orbits.  
</p>

<p>However, close encounters between planets can push them onto eccentric orbits, and in fact it seems 
that our solar system 
has unusually circular orbits.
A paper from 2014 discusses exoplanet eccentricity: <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.2552.pdf">The Exoplanet Orbital Eccentricity - Multiplicity
Eccentricity - Multiplicity Relation and the Solar System</a>, and refers to several reviews that discuss this 
phenomenon in more detail, before discussing the observation that systems with many planets tend to have more 
circular orbits.
</p>

<p>Another important consideration is that beyond a certain point (which appears to be at about 2.7 
astronomical units for our solar system according to wikipedia), water ice was stable in the protoplanetary disk,
and this created very many more planetesimals beyond that point --- which encourages or is necessary for 
the formation of giant planets (presumably because having more material from which to grow planets leads 
to faster planet growth, and they can reach a size large enough to gather hydrogen gas sooner).
 

<p>So where does this leave us in terms of making sure that planets are realistic? Really there are two answers
depending on how much effort the reader is willing to go to: <strike>The high-effort answer is 
that you can realistically simulate the solar system from the formation of thousands of planetesimals to
the presence of between 1 and several handfuls of planets, and the resulting planets would 
have a realistic history.</strike> This kind of simulation will take a long time to run, though, between days 
and months --- the dynamics need to be resolved down to timescales shorter than an hour, but the simulation
has to run to perhaps half a million years. The low-effort answer is that the planet-formation phase doesn't 
really impose much of a constraint on what's possible for a single planet. Planets can move around.
They can be on circular orbits or
they can be on eccentric orbits (more likely if there are fewer planets in your solar system). There
is no fundamental reason why large planets can't be close in, far out, etc.
</p>
<p>
However, there is always a big constraint that any multi-planet system should be dynamically stable on 
timescales of millions
of years. This is because a solar system that is fluctuating on fast timescales would eventually remove 
planets
until it stabilised again ... the solar system effectively searches out stable configurations and stays 
in those
for long periods of time. So if an intrepid explorer stumbles upon a 2 billion year old solar system, 
it is unlikely
that that system would be undergoing 1000-year changes, unless the explorer had specifically sought out a 
fluctuating system.
</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<ul>
<li>Our understanding of solar system formation places few constraints on the mass or orbit of planets around
realistic solar systems. It seems that it is possible for planets of any size to be anywhere.</li>
<li>It is important, though, that a realistic solar system is dynamically stable on timescales of millions of years.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Planet Formation: Chemical composition</h3>
<p>Our solar system tends to have rocky planets near the sun and icy planets further out. 
This is something that is somewhat important for a solar system to be believable. The story 
actually starts in the first stages of planet formation when grains of dust come together to form pebbles: 
Ice sublimes when it gets to too warm, and so the pebbles that form in the inner solar system are largely rocky.
(see wikipedia's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frost_line_(astrophysics)">frost line</a>). 
The same goes for CO<sub>2</sub> ice. So planetesimals that start closer in tend to be depleted in 
elements that prefer to be in chemicals with low boiling points.
